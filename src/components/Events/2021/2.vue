      <hr>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2nd national forum on geographic modeling and simulation (and the launch ceremony of the training course on domestic
        geographical analysis models) was successfully held in Nanjing Normal University during Jan 16th-17th, 2021. This forum
        was mainly organized by Key Laboratory of the Virtual Geographic Environment, Ministry of Education of PRC and School of Geography,
        Nanjing Normal University with several co-organizers including the Geographical Society of China (GSC), China Society of Natural
        Resources (CSNR), China Association for Geospatial Information Society (CAGIS), Chinese National Committee of International Society
        for Digital Earth (ISDE), International Environmental Modelling and Software Society (iEMSs), Modeling Geographical Systems Commission
        of International Geographical Union (IGU), Commission on Geospatial Analysis and Modeling of International Cartographic Association (ICA),
        Young Geographer Working Group of Asian Geographical Association (AGA), Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information
        Resource Development and Application, and Yangtze River Delta State Sub-center of National Earth System Science Data Center. Due to the
        prevention and control measures of COVID-2019, the forum was synchronously conducted in the onsite and offsite way with the support of
        Tencent Meeting, ZOOM, and Bilibili Live. <br></p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Geographic Modeling and Simulation Forum, which was founded in 2017 by Nanjing Normal University, aims to explore cutting-edge progress and scientific breakthroughs in the field of geographic modeling and simulation and to provide a unique platform for sharing scientific research achievements, exchange academic ideas, and strengthening academic cooperation among Chinese geographical modelers. Focusing on the development of domestic geographical analysis models and modeling platforms, this forum calls on Chinese geographical modelers to work together to develop domestic geographical analysis models and to build an ecological circle of autonomous model systems for the target of constructing Chinese autonomous geographical simulators and promoting the international researches in the fields of geographic modeling and simulation.
